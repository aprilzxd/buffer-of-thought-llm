### Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem

**Definition**: Solve a basic arithmetic problem by parsing the problem statement to identify numbers and operations, and then apply each operation sequentially.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- Use operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to compute the result.

**Solution Strategy**: Parse the problem statement to extract numbers and operations, initialize a result variable, and apply each operation sequentially.

**Example**: "What is 7 plus 5 minus 2?"

**Solution**:
- Parse numbers and operations: [7, 5, 2], ['+', '-']
- Initialize result: result = 7
- Apply operations:
  - result += 5 (result = 12)
  - result -= 2 (result = 10)

Comprehensive equation:  
7 + 5 - 2 = 10

### Problem Type 2: Word Problem

**Definition**: Translate a word problem into mathematical expressions and solve it by extracting relevant quantities and operations from the text.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- Convert text descriptions into mathematical expressions to find solutions.

**Solution Strategy**: Extract quantities and operations from the text, construct a mathematical expression, and evaluate it.

**Example**: "If you have 3 apples and buy 2 more, how many apples do you have?"

**Solution**:
- Extract quantities and operations: [3, 2], ['+']
- Construct expression: 3 + 2
- Evaluate expression: solution = 5

Comprehensive equation:  
3 + 2 = 5

### Problem Type 3: Algebraic Equation

**Definition**: Solve a simple algebraic equation by defining variables, parsing the equation string into a symbolic equation, and solving it.

**Quantitative Relationships**:
- Use algebraic manipulation to isolate variables and find solutions.

**Solution Strategy**: Define variables, parse the equation string into a symbolic equation, and solve for the variable(s).

**Example**: "Solve 2x + 3 = 11"

**Solution**:
- Define variable: x
- Parse equation: Eq(2x + 3, 11)
- Solve for x: x = (11 - 3) / 2 = 4

Comprehensive equation:  
x = (11 - 3) / 2 = 4
