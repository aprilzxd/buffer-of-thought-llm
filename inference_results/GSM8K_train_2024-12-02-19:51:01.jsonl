Mark is 7 years older than Amy, so Mark's current age is 15 + 7 = 22 years old.\n3.  We need to find Mark's age in 5 years.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo find Mark's age in 5 years, we can use the thought template for Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem.\n\n1.  Define variables: Mark's current age = Amy's current age + age difference\n    Mark's current age = 22\n2.  Parse the equation string into a symbolic equation\n    Mark's age in 5 years = Mark's current age + years to predict\n    Mark's age in 5 years = 22 + 5\n3.

{"input": "Joan has 2 hours to get all her music practice done. She spends 30 minutes on the piano, 25 minutes writing music on her computer, and 38 minutes reading about the history of the piano. Her final work is to use a special finger exerciser. How much time does she have left to use this?", "result": "## Problem Analysis\n\nGiven the distilled information, the goal is to calculate the remaining time for the finger exerciser. To solve this problem, we can use the **Quantitative Relationships** thought template, which involves solving arithmetic operations to compute a result.\n\n## Relevant Thought Templates\n\nBased on the meta buffer, the most relevant thought template for this problem is:\n\n### Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem\n**Quantitative Relationships**:\n- Age in 5 years = Current age + 5\n**Definition**: This type of problem involves solving arithmetic operations to compute a result.\n\nWe can adapt this template to our problem by replacing the \"Age in 5 years\" with \"Remaining time for the finger exerciser\" and the \"Current age\" with the \"Total available time\".\n\n## Solution Strategy\n\nTo calculate the remaining time for the finger exerciser, we need to:\n\n1. **Define variables**:\n\t* Total available time (TAT) = 120 minutes\n\t* Time spent on piano (T_piano) = 30 minutes\n\t* Time spent writing music (T_music) = 25 minutes\n\t* Time spent reading about the piano (T_reading) = 38 minutes\n2. **Calculate the total time spent on known activities**:\n\t* Total time spent = T_piano + T_music + T_reading\n3. **Subtract the total time spent from the total available time**:\n\t* Remaining time for the finger exerciser = TAT - Total time spent\n\n## Solution\n\nUsing the Python transformation provided, we can calculate the remaining time for the finger exerciser:\n\n```python\ntotal_time = 120\ntime_piano = 30\ntime_music = 25\ntime_reading = 38\ntime_exerciser = total_time - (time_piano + time_music + time_reading)\n```\n\n## Final Answer\n\nThe remaining time for the finger exerciser is: **27 minutes**."}
{"input": "An auctioneer raises the price of an item he is auctioning by $5 every time someone new bids on it. Two people enter a bidding war on a desk and the price goes from $15 to $65 before the desk is sold. How many times did each person bid on the desk?", "result": "**Problem Analysis and Solution**\n\nGiven the task description and the meta buffer, I will extract the most relevant thought templates to solve the problem.\n\n### Extracted Thought Templates\n\nFrom the meta buffer, the following thought templates are relevant to this problem:\n\n* **Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem**\n\t+ Definition: This type of problem involves solving arithmetic operations to compute a result.\n\t+ Example: \"If you have 3 apples and buy 2 more, how many apples do you have?\"\n* **Solution Strategy**: Define variables, parse the equation string into a symbolic equation, and solve it by applying each operation sequentially.\n* **Quantitative Relationships**: Identify the initial value, the increment, and the final value to determine the number of increments.\n\n### Analysis of the Task\n\nThe task involves determining the number of bids made by each person to reach the final price of $65, given that the price starts at $15 and increases by $5 each time a new bid is made. This is a classic example of a Basic Arithmetic Problem, where we need to find the number of increments required to reach the final value.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the thought template **Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem**. We define the initial price as the starting point, the price increment as the change in value, and the final price as the target value.\n\nLet's apply the solution strategy:\n\n1. Define variables:\n\t* Initial price: $15\n\t* Price increment: $5\n\t* Final price: $65\n2. Parse the equation string into a symbolic equation:\n\t* Let x be the number of increments\n\t* The equation becomes: 15 + 5x = 65\n3. Solve for x:\n\t* Subtract 15 from both sides: 5x = 50\n\t* Divide both sides by 5: x = 10\n\nSince there are two people bidding, we need to find the number of bids made by each person. Let's assume person A makes x bids and person B makes (number_of_bidders - 1) bids.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of bids made by each person can be calculated as follows:\n\n* Person A: x = 10\n* Person B: (number_of_bidders - 1) = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nPerson A: 10\nPerson B: 1"}
