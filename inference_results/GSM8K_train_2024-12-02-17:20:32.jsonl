{"input": "An auctioneer raises the price of an item he is auctioning by $5 every time someone new bids on it. Two people enter a bidding war on a desk and the price goes from $15 to $65 before the desk is sold. How many times did each person bid on the desk?", "result": "## Problem Analysis and Solution\n\n### Problem Description\n\nWe are given the initial price of a desk, the final price of the desk, and the uniform price increase of $5 each time a bid is made. Our goal is to determine the number of bids made by each person in the bidding war.\n\n### Relevant Thought Templates\n\nBased on the problem description, the following thought templates from the meta buffer are relevant:\n\n* **Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem** - Translate a word problem into mathematical expressions and solve it by extracting relevant quantities and operations from the text.\n* **Solution Strategy**: Parse the problem statement to extract numbers and operations, initialize a result variable, and apply each operation sequentially.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nWe can use the **Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem** thought template to solve this problem. The key quantities and operations are:\n\n* Initial price: $15\n* Final price: $65\n* Price increase: $5\n\nWe can initialize a result variable to keep track of the number of bids made. Since the price increase is uniform at $5 each time a bid is made, we can calculate the number of bids by subtracting the initial price from the final price and dividing by the price increase.\n\n### Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_number_of_bids(initial_price, final_price, price_increase):\n    # Calculate the number of bids\n    num_bids = (final_price - initial_price) // price_increase\n    \n    # Return the number of bids\n    return num_bids\n\n# Input parameters\ninitial_price = 15\nfinal_price = 65\nprice_increase = 5\n\n# Calculate the number of bids\nnum_bids = calculate_number_of_bids(initial_price, final_price, price_increase)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The number of bids made by each person is:\", num_bids)\n```\n\n### Answer\n\nThe answer is a tuple containing the number of bids made by each person, which is simply the result of the calculation:\n\n```python\nThe number of bids made by each person is: 10\n```\n\nNote that since the price must be an integer, we use the floor division operator (`//`) to get the integer part of the result."}
