{"input": "Mark is 7 years older than Amy, who is 15. How old will Mark be in 5 years?", "result": "**Problem Analysis and Solution**\n\nBased on the distilled information and the given meta buffer, we will use the following thought templates to solve the problem:\n\n* **Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem**: This type of problem involves solving arithmetic operations to compute a result.\n* **Solution Strategy**: Define variables, parse the problem statement to extract numbers and operations, and apply each operation sequentially.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nLet's define the variables based on the given information:\n\n* Amy's current age: amy_age = 15\n* Mark's age difference with Amy: mark_age_difference = 7\n\n**Step 2: Parse the Problem Statement**\n\nWe need to find Mark's age in 5 years. To do this, we first need to find Amy's age in 5 years, and then add 7 to it.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Amy's Age in 5 Years**\n\nAmy's age in 5 years = Amy's current age + 5\n= 15 + 5\n= 20\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Mark's Age in 5 Years**\n\nMark's age in 5 years = Amy's age in 5 years + Mark's age difference\n= 20 + 7\n= 27\n\nTherefore, Mark's age in 5 years is 27.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nMark's age in 5 years is **27**."}

Her final work is to use a special finger exerciser. How much time does she have left to use this?", "result": "**Problem Analysis and Solution**\n\nGiven the problem description and the meta buffer, we can identify the relevant thought templates to apply to this task. The problem is a basic arithmetic problem that involves calculating the remaining time after subtracting the time spent on piano, writing music, and reading about piano history from the total available time.\n\n**Extracted Thought Templates**\n\nBased on the meta buffer, the relevant thought templates are:\n\n1. **Basic Arithmetic Problem**: Solve a basic arithmetic problem by parsing the problem statement to identify numbers and operations, and then apply each operation sequentially.\n2. **Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem**: This type of problem involves solving arithmetic operations to compute a result.\n3. **Time Management Problem**: This type of problem involves managing time to complete tasks within a given time frame.\n\n**Analysis and Solution**\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the remaining time after subtracting the time spent on piano, writing music, and reading about piano history from the total available time. We can use the basic arithmetic problem thought template to solve this.\n\n**Step 1: Parse the problem statement**\n\n* Identify the total available time: 120 minutes\n* Identify the time spent on piano: 30 minutes\n* Identify the time spent writing music: 25 minutes\n* Identify the time spent reading about piano history: 38 minutes\n\n**Step 2: Apply the operation**\n\n* Subtract the time spent on piano, writing music, and reading about piano history from the total available time\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the result**\n\n* Remaining time = Total available time - (Time spent on piano + Time spent writing music + Time spent reading about piano history)\n* Remaining time = 120 - (30 + 25 + 38)\n* Remaining time = 120 - 93\n* Remaining time = 27\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe remaining time after subtracting the time spent on piano, writing music, and reading about piano history from the total available time is **27 minutes**."}
{"input": "An auctioneer raises the price of an item he is auctioning by $5 every time someone new bids on it. Two people enter a bidding war on a desk and the price goes from $15 to $65 before the desk is sold. How many times did each person bid on the desk?", "result": "**Problem Analysis and Solution**\n\nBased on the provided meta buffer and the distilled task, I will apply the relevant thought templates to solve the problem.\n\n**Relevant Thought Templates**\n\n* **Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem**: This type of problem involves solving arithmetic operations to compute a result. The thought template for this problem is to parse the problem statement to extract numbers and operations, initialize a result variable, and apply each operation sequentially.\n* **Solution Strategy**: Define variables, parse the equation string into a symbolic equation, and solve for the variable(s).\n* **Quantitative Relationships**: Apply operations to compute the result.\n\n**Analysis of the Task**\n\nThe problem requires determining the number of bids made by each person to reach a final price of $65, given that the price starts at $15 and increases by $5 each time someone bids. This is a basic arithmetic problem that can be solved by applying the thought template for Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem.\n\n**Solution**\n\nLet's define the variables and apply the operations to solve the problem:\n\n* Initial price of the desk: $15\n* Final price of the desk: $65\n* Price increment: $5\n* Number of bidders: 2\n\nWe can represent the problem as an equation:\n\nFinal price = Initial price + (Number of bids x Price increment)\n\nSince there are two bidders, we can assume that each bidder makes an equal number of bids. Let's call the number of bids made by each bidder \"x\". Then, the total number of bids is 2x.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n65 = 15 + (2x x 5)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n65 = 15 + 10x\n\nSubtracting 15 from both sides, we get:\n\n50 = 10x\n\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\n\n5 = x\n\nSince x represents the number of bids made by each bidder, the total number of bids is 2x = 2 x 5 = 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe number of bids made by each person to reach a final price of $65 is 5. The total number of bids is 10."}
