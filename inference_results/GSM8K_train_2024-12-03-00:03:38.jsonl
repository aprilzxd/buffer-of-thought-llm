{"input": "Mark is 7 years older than Amy, who is 15. How old will Mark be in 5 years?", "result": "**Problem Analysis and Solution**\n\nBased on the provided meta buffer and distilled information, we can identify the relevant thought template for solving this problem.\n\n### Thought Template\n\n1. **Define variables**: Mark's current age = Amy's current age + age difference\n   Mark's age in 5 years = 27\n2. **Parse equation**: Since the age difference remains constant, we can add the years to predict to Mark's current age to find his age in 5 years.\n\n### Solution Strategy\n\nTo find Mark's age in 5 years, we will follow the thought template and use the given information:\n\n* Mark's current age = Amy's current age + age difference\n* Mark's age in 5 years = Mark's current age + years to add\n\nGiven Amy's current age is 15 and the age difference is 7, we can calculate Mark's current age as follows:\n\nMark's current age = 15 + 7 = 22\n\nNow, we need to add the years to add (5) to Mark's current age to find his age in 5 years:\n\nMark's age in 5 years = 22 + 5 = 27\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mark_age():\n    amy_age = 15\n    years_to_add = 5\n    mark_age_difference = 7\n    \n    # Calculate Mark's current age\n    mark_current_age = amy_age + mark_age_difference\n    \n    # Calculate Mark's age in 5 years\n    mark_age_in_5_years = mark_current_age + years_to_add\n    \n    return mark_age_in_5_years\n\n# Execute the function\nmark_age = calculate_mark_age()\nprint(\"Mark's age in 5 years:\", mark_age)\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nMark's age in 5 years: 27"}
