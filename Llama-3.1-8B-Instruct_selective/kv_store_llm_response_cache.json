We know the initial price of the desk ($15), the price increase per bid ($5), and the final price of the desk ($65). We can use this information to find the number of bids made by each person.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's start by defining the relationship between the initial price, price increase, and final price. We can see that the final price is the initial price plus some multiple of the price increase. Let's call this multiple \"n\". \n\n**Equation:** final_price = initial_price + n * price_increase\n\nWe know the values of the final price, initial price, and price increase, so we can plug them into the equation to find \"n\".\n\n**Mathematical Expression:** (65 - 15) / 5 = 50 / 5 = 10\n\nThis means that the desk was bid on 10 times before it was sold.\n\n**Solution Strategy:** Since the price cannot be decreased and each bid increases the price by $5, the desk was bid on 10 times by one person. It was not bid on by another person.\n\n**Answer:** The answer is (10, 0), representing the number of bids made by each person before the desk is sold.\n\nHere is the Python code to verify the solution:\n\n```python\ninitial_price = 15\nprice_increase = 5\nfinal_price = 65\n\nn = (final_price - initial_price) / price_increase\nprint(int(n))\n```\n\nThis code will output `10`, which is the number of bids made by each person before the desk is sold.",
