    "content": "### Problem Type: Age Difference Problem\n\n**Definition**: This type of problem involves finding the age of one person given their age difference with another person.\n\n**Quantitative Relationships**:\n- A is B years older than C, where A is the older person and C is the younger person.\n- A's age = C's age + B\n\n**Solution Strategy**: Use the formula to find the older person's age by adding the age difference to the younger person's age.\n\n**Example**: Mark is 7 years older than Amy, who is 15. How old will Mark be in 5 years?\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Find Mark's current age by adding the years difference (7) to Amy's age (15): Mark's current age = 15 + 7 = 22\n2. Find Mark's age in 5 years by adding 5 to Mark's current age: Mark's age in 5 years = 22 + 5 = 27"

    "content": "### Problem Type: Student Halls Problem\n\n**Definition**: This type of problem involves a sequence of operations performed on a variable or variables to solve for an unknown value.\n\n**Quantitative Relationships**:\n- The problem statement can be represented mathematically as an equation, where the unknown value is the solution.\n- The equation can be solved using basic algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n**Solution Strategy**: Parse the problem statement to extract numbers and operations, initialize a result variable, and apply each operation sequentially.\n\n**Example**: Missy had a giant piggy bank in her bedroom. Every day she would search the house for change to put in her bank. After 4 years, the bank was opened and it contained $450 in change. If the second, third, and fourth-year she doubled the amount of money she put in the bank from the amount she had put in the previous year, how much money, in dollars, did she put in the bank the first year?\n\n**Solution**:\nLet's denote the amount of money Missy put in the bank the first year as x.\n\nWe can represent the situation mathematically as:\n\nx + 2x + 4x + 8x = 450\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n15x = 450\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\nx = 450 / 15\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\n# Define the variables\ntotal_amount = 450\n\n# Calculate the value of x\nx = total_amount / 15\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(x)\n```"
