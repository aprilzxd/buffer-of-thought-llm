{"input": "Mark is 7 years older than Amy, who is 15. How old will Mark be in 5 years?", "result": "### Problem Analysis and Solution\n\nBased on the provided information, we can identify the relevant thought templates from the meta buffer to solve this problem.\n\n#### Relevant Thought Templates\n\n* **Problem Type 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem**: This template involves solving arithmetic operations to compute a result. The problem statement involves Mark's age difference with Amy, which remains constant over time.\n* **Solution Strategy**: Define variables, parse the equation string into a symbolic equation, and solve for the variable(s). In this case, we need to find Mark's age in 5 years, given the age difference and Amy's current age.\n\n#### Problem Analysis\n\nWe are given that Mark is 7 years older than Amy, who is currently 15 years old. We need to find Mark's age in 5 years, while maintaining the age difference constant.\n\n#### Solution\n\nLet's apply the thought template to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Define variables**: Mark's current age = Amy's current age + age difference\n   Mark's current age = 15 + 7 = 22\n2. **Parse the equation**: Since the age difference remains constant, we can add the years to predict to Mark's current age to find his age in 5 years.\n   Mark's age in 5 years = Mark's current age + years to predict\n   Mark's age in 5 years = 22 + 5\n3. **Solve for the variable**: Calculate Mark's age in 5 years.\n   Mark's age in 5 years = 27\n\n#### Final Answer\n\nMark's age in 5 years will be 27."}
